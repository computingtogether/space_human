# Space Human

This program is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/tic-tac-toe) curriculum. 

The assignment was to create a "hangman" game, but I rebranded my version as "space human" for two reasons. One, to not make light of history of lynching and systemic racism in the United States. And two, to not gender a game title with "man". Thus, my game is "Space Human," where the goal is to guess the mystery word and launch the human further into space. 

The game is lost when you run out of guesses. Each complete guessed adds 9 new guesses to your running guesses total, and you are given a new word to attempt to guess. 

You can save and load a game at any point. 

You can play the game on repl [here](https://repl.it/@computeTogether/spacehuman).
